# RotanaJobs
 RSS Parser
 implement a new web page  app that should:
- Read the jobs from bayt client RSS: ( https://www.rotanacareers.com/rss/all/)
- Parse the fetched jobs to get the job titles.
- Draw the jobs in table view. And,
- Draw the jobs based on locations on google maps (you can chose javascript or any backend language)
Output: Two view pages
1) all rotana jobs titles Vs location in a table view.
2) all rotana jobs titles distributed over google maps based on the job's location.
